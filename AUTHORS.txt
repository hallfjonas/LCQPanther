Development of LCQPow algoritm has been developed by the
following main developers (in alphabetical order):

    Jonas Hall


SCIENTIFIC MENTORS
==================

We would also like to acknowledge the scientific contributors during
the development of this algorithm, who established the idea of using
a sequential quadratic programming approach in combination with the
hotstarting technique. Additionally, they gave excellent guidance
throughout the development phase of this project.

    Moritz Diehl
    Florian Messerer
    Armin Nurkanovic



All users are invited to further improve LCQPow by providing comments,
code enhancements, bug reports, additional documentation or whatever you
feel is missing.
