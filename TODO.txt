========

1) qpOASES:
1.1) Schur Complement (Requested MA57 solver)
1.2) Sparsity 

2) OSQP
2.1) Solve warm up
2.2) Solve IVOCP

3) Interfaces
3.1) MATLAB
3.2) Python
3.3) C++ API for standard QP formats? 

4) Benchmark
4.1) MIQP
4.2) Smooth/Relaxed/NLP

5) Global Convergence Proof
5.1) Outer Loop Convergence
     -> Assume complementarity variables are not involved in other linear constraints
     => 0 in convex relaxed feasible set
     => increasing penalty param will lead to penalty satisfaction
5.2) Inner Loop Convergence
     -> psi'(xj)(xj*-xj) < 0
     -> xj+1 is chosen such that psi(xj+1) <= psi(xj), since it minimizes psi along xj + alpha pj
     -> psi coercive on relaxed feasible set
     -> (xj)j bounded sequence in R^n
     -> xj has convergent subsequence ...

6) Non-Monotonous Penalty Updates

 OTHER TODOS 
=============

1) Document code correctly. Current Solution:
	=> Doxygen comments of member functions and properties in header files
	=> Leave comments above member functions away in source files
	=> Comment code functionality in source files

2) valgrind

3) Make Member Attributes in Options private? This would allow to better ensure consistency.

4) Loop Warm Up Problem run. Why does it not work always?
