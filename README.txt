INTRODUCTION
============

lcqpOASES extends qpOASES with the recently proposed solution strategy for
Quadratic Programs with Complementarity Constraints. The approach is based on
a standard penalty homotopy reformulated using sequential convex programming.
The convex sequence derives from linearizing the (necessarily) nonconvex 
penalty function. This leads to a constant objective Hessian matrix throughout
all iterates, and thus enables us to solve the linear complementarity quadratic
program with a single factorization of the KKT matrix (by using qpOASES).
