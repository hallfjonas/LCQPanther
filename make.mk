## User Configuration (adapt to your local settings)
## NOTE: We assume all external libraries to be placed into /usr/local/lib, such that no further linking is required.
##    	If you desire to link an external library from elsewhere,
## 		please do so by adding the path via -L/path-to-external-lib-dir -lexternal
## 		In this case, make sure that your system can find this library (e.g. by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
