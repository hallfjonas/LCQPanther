%
%LCQPanther is intended for solving quadratic programs with
%linear complementarity constraints of the form
%
%                min   1/2*x'Hx + x'g
%                s.t.    0 <= S1*x
%                        0 <= S2*x
%                        0  = x'*S1'*S2*x
%                       lb <=  x <= ub      {optional}
%                      lbA <= Ax <= ubA     {optional}
%
%I) Call
%
%    [x] = LCQPanther( H,g,S1,S2,{params} )
%or
%    [x] = LCQPanther( H,g,S1,S2,lb,ub,{params} )
%or
%    [x] = LCQPanther( H,g,S1,S2,A,lbA,ubA,{params} )
%or
%    [x] = LCQPanther( H,g,S1,S2,A,lbA,ubA,lb,ub,{params}).
%
%II) The optional params struct may contain the following fields:
%
%                             x0 : Initial primal guess.
%                             y0 : Initial dual guess.
%          stationarityTolerance : Tolerance for 1-Norm of stationarity violation.
%       complementarityTolerance : Complementarity tolerance.
%        initialPenaltyParameter : Start value for complementarity penalty term.
%            penaltyUpdateFactor : Factor for updating penaltised complementarity term.
%          solveZeroPenaltyFirst : Flag indicating whether first QP should ignore penalization.
%                  maxIterations : Maximum number of iterations to be performed.
%                     printLevel : The amount of output to be printed.
